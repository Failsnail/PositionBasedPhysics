PositionBasedPhysics
====================

A physics engine using a position-based-dynamics-like method of simulating.

I don't expect anybody to ever read this, but if you're interested; my main reference is

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15462-s13/www/lec_slides/Jakobsen.pdf

but the exact formulas I use are from classical mechanics, some changed by me for my specific usecase.
These aren't documented around here but if you are curious, just leave an issue.

feel free to leave a message of some sort (just place an issue), I'm not too experienced with coding so if anyone would be so nice to dig around a bit (the project isn't that big) and leave an issue with comments on whatever tips, recomendations or whatever that would be verry much appreciated.
