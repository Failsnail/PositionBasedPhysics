todo:
! in the constraint and softforce classess, check if the particle is currently active in getParticle

wrap the arrays of particles in a dedicated object
gui
gravity softforce
spring softforce
damper softforce
import/export system
clean the simulator and worldstate classes (mabye make a possibility to choose between multiple integration methods while were at it)
change the arrays (to vectors or pointers), in order to change the size of the arrays at runtime (or when files are imported)
